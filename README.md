# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
A chief data scientist for a city school district requested help with anlayzing student funding and standardized testing results to find performance trends and patterns.  Specifically, the deliverables requested were as follows:

   1. A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics
   2. An overview of the key metrics for each school
   3. Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
        * Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
        * The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
        * The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
        * School performance based on the budget per student
        * School performance based on the school size 
        * School performance based on the type of school
   4. Comparison of each metric after removing altered test scores for Freshman at Thomas High School
